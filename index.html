I am a recent graduate of Washington University's Olin Business School with majors in Leadership and Strategic
Management and Operations and Supply Chain Management. I grew up in a suburb of Nashville, TN and attended
Brentwood High School where I participated in varsity tennis, National Honor Society, and Habitat for Humanity. 
I also was a member of the Boy Scouts of America and earned my Eagle Scout award in early 2012. 

I enjoy hiking, spending time with friends, and keeping up with my favorite TV shows.
